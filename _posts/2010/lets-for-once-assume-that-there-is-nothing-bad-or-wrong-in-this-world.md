Well lets just once assume in this world. I mean let the person kill someone if he wants to. Let a person rob someone if he wishes to. Let anyone become a suicide bomber or a terrorist if he/she wants to do it under someoneâ€™s influence. What a world would that be. It would be horrific, right. No, It would not be horrible, It would be great because the way I look at it is that if we use the technology to an extent where all these bad activities would not even be remotely possible. I would want to live in a world like that.

I wish technology advances so much that it does not leave any chance of error for humans. For example
<ul>
 	<li>People could freely shop online and never be afraid of their bank details being leaked and hacked.</li>
 	<li>I want the examination system to be like that it does not let anyone cheat.</li>
 	<li>A world where if a crime is committed the culprit can never escape and gets the punishment instantly.</li>
 	<li>A world where piracy will not be illegal. It will be legal because it would be upto the publishers to protect their creations/products/music/movies etc. And because the technology would be so strong that it does not even leave a chance for anyone to pirate.</li>
 	<li>Where Microsoft does not have to be afraid over WGA cracks anymore because they know that their activation process is so amazing that no one can make copies.</li>
</ul>
What do you think about it ? Do you wanna live into that kind of world. Where you have all the freedom to do anything in this world and no one would complain about that.
