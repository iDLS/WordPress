I saw it coming. I knew [ISRO Chandrayaan](https://web.archive.org/web/20130308094546/http://www.revolutioners.com/google-earth-helped-terrorists-but-isro-bhuvan-will-not-what-a-joke/) was going to be a failure. I had doubts and ISRO has not left me with any doubts now. Our government has already wasted m0ney on [ISRO Bhuvan ](https://web.archive.org/web/20130308094546/http://www.revolutioners.com/google-earth-helped-terrorists-but-isro-bhuvan-will-not-what-a-joke/)and now this.

These guys aren’t over yet. They still wants to waste our money. I am not in favor of these kinds of missions. As stated earlier I want our government to invest in Indian Infrastructure. Build new Railway tracks, build new airports, build better roads; I mean there are millions of things that our government could do. Our government just simply wasted 81 million $ which could have been utilized in a better manner.  It does not matter whether we spent lesser money compared to what others have. All that matters is that we did waste money. And what is bothering me now is that our government is not ready to learn any lesson from this.

“The mission is definitely over. We have lost contact with the spacecraft,” Mayilsamy Annadurai, Project Director of the Chandrayaan-1, told PTI. He said the mission had almost completed its scientific objectives. **“It has done its job technically … 100 per cent. Scientifically also, it has done almost 90-95 per cent of its job,”** said Mr. Annadurai.

What job are we talking about here. What did ISRO Chandrayaan achieve. I am not sure. Can someone throw some light on the achievements of our ISRO Chandrayaan mission apart from some pictures being taken from it.

The mission was built to be failed. Its been proven now.
