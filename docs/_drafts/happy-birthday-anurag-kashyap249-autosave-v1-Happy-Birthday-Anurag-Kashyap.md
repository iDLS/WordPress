I still remember it was late in the year 2012. Winters had arrived and I was employed at an MNC. My daily commute from work to office and office to work involved a travel time of around 3-4 hours. I would use this time to watch movies on my laptop. It was the time when I watched _Gangs of Wasseypur_ for the first time. I had heard of Black Friday before that and the drama that engulfed the movie which was not released in India due to censor board. However the availability of the pirated movie online had created a ripple in the Bollywood industry. And ever since I have seen _Gangs of Wasseypur_, something changed in me.

In the last 5 years I have seen _Gangs of Wasseypur_ for almost 50 times and almost all the possible videos on YouTube including the making and officially  uncut videos of the movie. I heard a mini series of 8 episodes was put by Netflix. And it was a different extended version of Gangs of Wasseypur. I think it would be a good idea if Anurag can release an extra extended version on Blue Ray and make it more awesome by adding more scenes to it. And probably you can call it

[_**Gangs of Wasseypur Plus**_](http://www.revolutioners.com/happy-birthday-anurag-kashyap/)

To be frank I started following **Anurag Kashyap** after watching _Gangs of Wasseypur_ and religiously watched all of his work including _Gulaal_ and _Black Friday_.

For the last 5 years I have wished you birthday only in the air due to me not exposing myself online. I had once even recorded a small video as well about a contest for all the Anurag&#8217;s fans. And the prize was Blue Rays of DVDs of all Anurag Kashyap&#8217;s movies. But I could never publish that on-line. May be it was not the right time for me. But this time I am convinced that you will get my wishes Anurag. I am writing this because I appreciate a unique skill set that _you_ possess and **that** no other movie director in India can possess. And that is to deliver your story as realistic as possible. You have an eye for brilliance. A mind filled with questions and their answers. A perspective like yours is to cherish for the lifetime.
