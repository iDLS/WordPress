revolutioners as a word is composed of revolution +er + s

So far, at least up until the birth of revolutioners.com this word was not used to address a group of people involved in some kind of revolt or revolution. They used to be referred as revolutionaries.

we at rLOVEutioners decided to create a new word all together to address as revolutioners, instead of revolutionaries.

rLOVEuutioners has a lot of hidden meaning to it. For example the EVOL after r becomes LOVE if read backwards.

EVOL -> LOVE

EVOLution with LOVE

the letter r turns the entire composition into a recursive infinite loop to signify continuation of revolution
