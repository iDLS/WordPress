Its been almost 10 years now that I registered this domain revolutioners.com. It feels as if it was yesterday. I can still feel the adrenaline rush to get a perfect domain name for the entrepreneurial journey I had at that time in my mind. Though the process to create revolutioners had initiated long before that.

While I was clear with what I had to do with the domain but still It took me a considerable amount of time initially. Most of the time was spent to learn various technologies to run a blog or a community. I had no formal training for creating websites. Learning curve was steep. After a lot of trail and error I was finally able to have an understanding of how the web works. I had always considered the open source community a real social service that the developers community and people in the open source front were doing.

My initial years went into having a mind towards creating a community to exchange ideas and solve each others problems. Then I grew in compassion and decided to write my own thoughts via revolutioners. I started a community on phpBB in early days. A php based forum script available for free to use. In 2008 there were only forums for people to engage. Blogs and Blogging had not taken off yet.
