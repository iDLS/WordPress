Alright, I think its the time that I talk about the burning issue of Commonwealth Games supposed to be held in Delhi, India. I think we are trying our best to keep them here but somehow I am getting this feeling that we are not ready. Our government has not even started the construction of some of the stadiums. We I really wish our Indian Government best of luck. May God bless them with some wisdom. Why do these guys not understand that it will be less shameful if we tell the Commonwealth Games community that we are not ready to host the event rather then the athletes coming to India and coming to know that we are not even able to provide the basic facilities to them. Forget about organizing the Commonwealth Games 2010.

Anyways, If I assume it happens and we have all the stadiums ready to organize the games. Though our government has to do a really good job here to crack this nut. What if the people of India are not ready. We are overlooking this part. We have not even considered this factor yet. There will be a huge number of foreigners coming to Delhi and Indian tourism will get a drastic boost during September till December 2010.

I feel there are certain things that we need to take are as Indian citizens. People who are coming from other countries will not be familiar with our countries, so we will have to make sure we help them as much as we can. China was ready for Olympics a year ago from the actual event and we are running late.

Today I am just asking to you remember these 10 things which if done properly would definitely make our country better in terms of hospitality and people coming from other countries will also look at as developing country not under developed.

<strong>Give Shelter</strong> : As per Indian Government, Delhi is going to be short of accommodation for at least 6,000 tourists coming to Delhi. I urge every Delhite to make sure if you know someone who is coming to see Commonwealth Games then ask them to stay with you at your house if possible. Otherwise it will really be shameful to not to have space to stay for them.

<strong>Have some Generosity</strong> : You might have seen it already when people come from the western side of the world in India they are being overcharged by Indian people. To a certain limit its acceptable. But when people coming at this large scale I don’t think it will be required to do that. So I would urge you all Indians to not to promote such things. If you see some auto rickshaw or taxi driver or any shopkeeper overcharging the foreigners, please go help them.

<strong>Keep your city Clean</strong> : Don’t just pee and spit anywhere, I know many of you are reading this would not come under that category, but just think about it. Our government has spent millions in creating places for emergencies like these. I wish we had a rule for penalizing anyone who is found to be spitting on road. And anyone not following it would be charged 500 Rs on the spot. And mainly those Gukta guys, I just can’t explain it. So, guys please mind your tongue for 2 months at least.

<strong>Learn to behave</strong> : We by nature are very generous and hospitable, but only for Indians and our brothers. We need to show this hospitality to everyone who is coming to our country. This is the only way we can show our hospitality to the world and people who would come and visit our mother land. Remember<strong> ” Athiti Devo Bhava”</strong> There might be people who are coming to India for the first time and would expect everything to go right.

<strong>Help National Security</strong> : We saw terrorist attacks in Mumbai and Delhi this year and last year as well. Mumbai Blasts, Delhi Blasts etc. I am not sure what our government has learnt from it. But I want you to help avoid these kind of mishaps. Help our Security professionals to keep our country safe. I would request you all to report anything you suspect.

<strong>Follow traffic rules</strong> : <em>Better late then never</em>, what is this. I don’t understand. Who is <em>late</em>, what is never. I don’t know. All I know is I am getting late and if the traffic signal is not working then I am not going to wait. Please, don’t don’t do this. Don’t show that we don’t have traffic manners. Indians need to understand that traffic rules are not meant to be broken only, then are suppose to be followed as well. Its OK if you wait for 2 minutes and let other pass. If you notice, in hurry you spend 15 minutes standing on the signal because you stuck everybody on the signal. Don’t <a href="http://www.revolutioners.com/tips-for-rash-driving-on-indian-roads/">drive rash</a> on roads during the games.

<strong>Respect their cultures</strong> : We might see people coming from various countries and cultures. We need to learn to respect their cultures. Their way of living will be different. In western culture display of public affection is not bad but in our culture its not suppose to be a good thing. We need to come out of this conservative ideology and start behaving like a developed country. If we need to be a Developed Country.
