ISRO announced today that they will bring Bhuvan the Google Earth competitor in the market. The main feature of <a href="http://www.revolutioners.com/isro-chandrayaan-fails-plans-to-waste-money-again-with-chandrayaan-2/">ISRO</a> Bhuvan would be that compared to Google Earth, ISRO Bhuvan will be able to zoom till 10 meter anywhere in India. Now tell me last time when terrorists attacked on Parliament and 26/11, our politicians said that these guys used Google earth. Will they not have a better tool now. I am not able to understand why <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.revolutioners.com/commonwealth-games-2010-things-you-can-do-to-contribute-for-a-successful-event/">Indian Government</span> is funding such pathetic projects. Another such example of failure is Chandrayaan. I mean I don’t understand why would India send a satellite on moon to find out what ? US have done the research there is nothing that Indian scientists will reveal now. And whatever happened was expected out of it. Chandrayaan was utter failure. All Indian tax payer’s money is going in vain. Nothing is being done for the safety of civilians.

We are still living in the same unprotected world where you don’t know whether you will be alive tomorrow or not. People are so scared to come out of their houses. If there is no terrorist attacks then there are internal terrorists, I mean every day you hear about kidnapping, murders and robberies. Everyday there is a new story about crime. I am sick and tired of listening to these kind of news. I wish I could do something about it. Our law and order needs to be changed. People after being convicted as well roam freely in India. That's how our law works. Anyways, I think I deviated from the topic. So what I was saying is that the same way we failed in <a href="http://www.revolutioners.com/isro-chandrayaan-fails-plans-to-waste-money-again-with-chandrayaan-2/">Chandrayaan</a>. ISRO Bhuvan is also going to fail, these guys don’t know what they are up against. Its Google.

Oh my God. We seriously need some developers in Indian Government Department. <a href="http://www.revolutioners.com/where-the-hell-are-indian-web-developers/">Our government websites are damn funny</a>. I can’t even begin to tell you.
