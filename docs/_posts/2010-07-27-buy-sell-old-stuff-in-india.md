Well, then the good news is that you don’t have to run after the buyer anymore. There is a growing community of buying and selling old stuff online day by day in India. I am proving you with the resource where one buy and sell old stuff in India.&nbsp; It all works on trust. People buy and sell stuff purely basis the trust they have gained in the community.&nbsp; These communities are so popular now the the dealers from every corner from India go and register there and provide the products at cheaper rates compared to market.

  1. <a href="http://www.team-bhp.com/forum/classifieds/" rel="nofollow">Team bhp</a> – This is an Automotive Community in India. Very popular. You can buy and sell almost anything here. Cars, Bikes and Gadgets.
  2. Tech Enclave &#8211;&nbsp; Techenclave is my first forum which inspired me to write this post. I started buying and selling stuff in this forum first. Again buy and sell anything here but as the name suggests most of the stuff is related to computers. Group Orders is the most.
  3. <a href="http://www.erodov.com/forums/bazaar/" rel="nofollow">Erodov</a> – Erodov is one neat forum with buy and sell section optimized to the fullest. With clear categories defined for buyers and sellers I have started loving Erodov now.
  4. <a href="http://www.rimweb.in/forums/forum/50-buy-sell-bazaar/" rel="nofollow">Rim Web</a> – Rimweb may be one of the oldest mobile community. I registered here when I started using Reliance Mobile. I still use it<img class="wp-smiley" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130308094606im_/http://revolutioners.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" /> Well people come here and buy sell their mobile phones primarily. You can also find other stuff here. But primarily, Mobiles.
  5. <a href="http://www.hifivision.com/classifieds/" rel="nofollow">HiFi Vision</a> – HiFi Vision is the most renowned Indian forum related to audio and video. Its like the AVS Forum but that is for the bigger world. HiFi Vision is for Indian Audio-Videophiles.
  6. <a href="http://www.thinkdigit.com/forum/bazaar/" rel="nofollow">Think Digit</a> – ThinkDigit forum is the official forum from the tech magazine company called Think Digit. Mostly the reader of the magazine come here and buy sell their old computer related stuff.
  7. <a href="http://www.xbhp.com/classifieds/" rel="nofollow">xBhp</a> – xBhp is one of the most browsed Biking Community Forum in India. So here, what to expect other than bikes. If you are thinking about selling that old bike. Go there.
  8. <a href="http://forums.techarena.in/buy-sell-computer-hardware/" rel="nofollow">Tech Arena</a> &#8211;&nbsp; To be very frank and true, I don’t have any idea about this forum as I never visited this one. I found this forum had a Buy/Sell category and a considerable amount of post in that section so I thought it would be good to share the link with you. No harm in sharing anything. right !
  9. India Broadband Forum &#8211;&nbsp; Oh.. Indian Broadband Forum started with the Broadband scene in India but then gradually picked up many other topics and now is a full fledged tech forum with variety of topics. I am a regular visitor to this forum from the last 4-5 years at least. I registered here when I used to use Sify Broadband. Yeah ! those were the best days of my life. that dc++ hub. I still miss it.. Anyways, again never went to the buy/sell section on this forum, but since the traffic to this forum is huge so I am expecting people do trade here.
 10. <a href="http://www.jjmehta.com/forum/index.php?board=8.0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">JJMehta </a>&#8211; This forums is for Photography enthusiasts so obviously you can sell and purchase photography equipments like Camera, dSLR and Lenses.

Mostly you would find people selling their stuff in multiple forums i.e. they are registered on all of the forums.

**Important : Please read the rules of the respective forums as they all operate on their own rules and regulations. You don’t wanna get burnt as soon as you start.**

I know I have missed a lot of good forums. I will keep updating the list whenever I get to know about anything new. But I listed the ones I knew and am a regular visitor. If you have a longer list do let me know I will definitely add them here.
