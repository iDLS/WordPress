Have you ever noticed it. You take out your vehicle and start your journey to your usualy daily destination. But suddenly you see a dead street dog on the road. The dog was over ran by some vehicle. I don’t know about you guys, but I get very disappointed and feel bad about it.

I decided to write about it today because I saw one dead dog on the road while coming back from office.

I have seen this a lot of times. Some times really nice dogs are found dead. I am a dog lover. I adore them a lot. It does not matter whether its a street dog or a pet dog.

On this, I am asking your suggestion. How can we reduce these kind of incidents. As of now our government has failed to do anything on this. It takes atleast 2-3 days to clean up that dead body from the road. This is how our Muncipality department works.

Now let me talk more about our non profit organizations. I am not in touch with any of them so I don’t know how well they operate. But I feel except 10% or the non-profit organizations in India all are fraud. They are just there to earn money. Its a business for them. Social service is not the cause for them.

What do you guys suggest , how can we stop or reduce these kind incidents. I have just given you an idea about dog but there are many other animals that I see dead and ran over by some vehicle.
