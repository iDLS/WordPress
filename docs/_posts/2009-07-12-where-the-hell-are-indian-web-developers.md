What are you thinking now ? Does India not have good Web Developers ? Why Indian Govt websites are such pathetic to look. Is Indian Govt running out of Funds for spending money on our Country’s website. I mean this is the only thing the world looks at now days for a legitimate source of information. I feel Indian Govt websites are created just for the sake of creating them. So what do you think is responsible for this situation. Let me tell you one thing before you come to any conclusion. India has more than 50% of the Software Development Industry business. Its our sick old politicians. Who, in 21st Century don’t even know how a computer is operated. Till the time we have the old generation ruling India, we the younger generation will keep facing the issues.
