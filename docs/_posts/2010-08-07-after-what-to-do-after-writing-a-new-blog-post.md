Do you also feel the same way as I do. I mean do you not feel a bit relaxed after writing that post. I get a sense of accomplishment every time and I am sure you do too. But remember that when you’re done writing a new blog post, you still have some work to do. There are many things you should be doing after writing a new post and I will try and explain a few of the most important things you should do after every blog post you write.

**#1 Edit Your Post**

Well, I do it all the time and still end up with some minor typos. Why I am saying you should always edit your post is because I don’t know about other people but I like to write my posts in one go. I am not that blogger who sits back and writes one post in 1 month. So most of the time I write my posts in 10 to 15 minutes max. Don’t publish your post until it has been completely edited and checked for spelling/grammar errors. Read over it carefully and make sure everything flows and that everything is written correctly. Like I said, It doesn’t have to be perfect but you don’t want it to be full of errors either. You also want to make sure all your spelling and punctuation is correct. One good way to do this is to paste it into MS Word and run a spell check. Like I am doing it right now<img class="wp-smiley" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130308094704im_/http://revolutioners.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" /> 

**#Share the Post on Social Networks**

In the recent past a lot of Social boom has happened so everyone is jumping in the wagon. Therefore the next thing you want to do after you write a blog post is to share your post with as many people as you can. There are a lot of social bookmarking websites on the internet that you can use to do this. Some of the best and most popular are Stumbleupon, Digg, Delicious, Mixx, and Reddit. Make sure you bookmark your post to at least a few of them.

**#3 Tweet It**

Twitter has really picked up the speed in social networking in the last year or so. Its like the small version of big posts. Sometimes people want to elaborate on their thinking and sometimes they just post a shorter version of that. Any which ways twitter is hot nowadays. So after you write a new blog post you should always “tweet” it. Twitter is really popular right now and it only takes a few seconds to tweet your followers about your post. This can give you extra traffic and maybe even a few people will retweet it or link to your post, which will help even more. So make sure you take a little time to tweet about your post whenever you publish a new one.

Alright, that should be enough to get you started. Just remember that after you finish writing a blog post you aren’t done with the work. If you do the things listed above then you will have a much better shot at building a successful blog.

**#4 Comment on other Blogs with post link**

This in my views is one of the most effective way ot getting traffic to your blog or site. As soon as you write a post, start going to your favorite blogs and comment with url of the new post that you written. Give the Name accordingly. Some Blog admins don’t mind accepting your name as your blog name if the comment adds something to the conversation.
