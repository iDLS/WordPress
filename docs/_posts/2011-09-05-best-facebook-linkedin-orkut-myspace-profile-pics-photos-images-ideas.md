While I was hunting for suitable theme for Revolutioners, I stumbled upon a theme website. The theme was not that good but the content on that site made me post this article. It had lot of images of a single person. I thought it would be a good idea to have it as a single point to refer in case anyone is looking for ideas for his/her next Facebook or any other Social Media profile picture. I saved the whole site as Image and posting it here on my blog. I really liked the ideas of the pictures shown on the blog. If you need inspiration for clicking your own picture for your social website’s profile then look nowhere else. The image is really long and huge in size. So be careful.
