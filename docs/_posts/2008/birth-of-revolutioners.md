<pre>outpowerhosting: ok.. ok.. gimme your domain name once again.. make  sure it's spelt correctly
 
Kuldeep: accha u suggest a good one
 
outpowerhosting: 2 mins gone :D
 
Kuldeep: I'll give u the background
 koi nahin
 bahut time hai tere paas
 outpowerhosting: k
 letshelpgovt.com?
 
Kuldeep: I will be running a forum where people talk about their problems that they face in their day to day life
 and then people will suggest the soultion
 
outpowerhosting: helpme.com
 not available
 
Kuldeep: and may be ... may be . we can get some politicians or govt officials to look at those ideas and imprelemt them
 
outpowerhosting: hmmmm.. good thought
 
Kuldeep: accha everythng apart
 idea kaisa hai
 
outpowerhosting: helpmeindia.com
 
Kuldeep: ab to tujhe paise bhi mil gaye hai
 jhoot mat boolna
 outpowerhosting: lol..never lied
 
Kuldeep: accha cloremint khate ho
 
outpowerhosting: sometimes
 
Kuldeep: tabhi...
 accha think about domain name
 i gave u the idea
 it will not be limited to india
 
outpowerhosting: k
 
Kuldeep: for ur informaiton
 thats why i opted ,com domain
 outpowerhosting: k
 
Kuldeep: agar chali to i am thinking of a very large community
 outpowerhosting: but the domain you suggested had no relevance to the idea.. I first though it was about complaints to the govt and help them in some way

 Kuldeep: thats why i was asking you for more bandwidth
 haan
 outpowerhosting: we'll see.. as the site grows.. I'll help out with the needs
 
Kuldeep: first let govt know what is wrong
 and then people from community will give idea that what should govt do
 they'll discuss about that
 
outpowerhosting: don't' you think it's better to anchor it to one region..
 because it's too vast a subject to be a worldwide one
 
Kuldeep: well i am assuming not much people other than Asian continent will turn up in the forum
 so its kinda anchored in this region
 and moreover US UK govt doesn't need help
 
outpowerhosting: if i were to use the forum.. I should feel like.. ok.. I'm going to post my problem in some forum in which India is just one of the countries...

 Kuldeep: why
 
outpowerhosting: I should feel confident that someone is going to listen and that there are people who understand the situation

 Kuldeep: can u not talk about a problem in US
 
outpowerhosting: not that I'm just going to post and hope just hope that an Indian sees it
 
Kuldeep: well i can
 why
 yaar share your information

 outpowerhosting: kuldeep.. the idea is there.. but everyone doesn't think like you and me..
 
Kuldeep: lets see what others have to say
 
outpowerhosting: we have generalize it to suit the millions
 
Kuldeep: i mean a problem is in India
 right
 people from India to dekhenge hi
 
outpowerhosting: yeah.. i know..
 but like i said..
 
Kuldeep: par bahar wale aa kar suggestions denge tabhi to kucch accha sochnege
to govt ke badle kucch aur hona chahiye tu bol raha hai
 
outpowerhosting: like i said.. i shouldn't feel like I'm just one in the world.. it would feel much better if I'm one in India... besides.. who's stopping people from outside posting something in a forum related to India
 what i meant is
 it should be region specific
 or what you do is
 have the main domain
 and then create sub domain
 like india.helpthegovt.com
 and then on your main page
 list the countries
 which will lead to a forum
 
Kuldeep: Faizal see my motto is to get information ...inside information that you don't know from Bangladesh
 China
 Pakistan
 right
 India
 I can't be there all the time
 but people are there
 and if they post something only then I'll know about it na
 and then only i can suggest something
 
outpowerhosting: yes... the reason the information is inside and not public is because only people from that region know it.. and they wouldn't bother telling it to someone else.. if you give them the comfort that they are telling it to people of their same region.. they will feel much more confident to open up..
 do you understand what I'm saying?
 so.. let it be global.. but create sub domains that are region specific
 
Kuldeep: So u are saying people from Pakistan won't talk about their govt with Indian people
 creating sub domains will be hell lot of a work
 
outpowerhosting: not everyone will if they think their enemy is going to read it
 i know.. no pain.. no gain
 
Kuldeep: i mean moderating and managing

outpowerhosting: well.. if there are lot of people then.. obviously you can part that job with others..
 but till then I don't think it should be an issue

Kuldeep: but as of now i don't have anyone that's why i was thinking of having it in one
 
outpowerhosting: are.. people will come only when you open the forum
 ok..
 
Kuldeep: I am the only person

 outpowerhosting: then do one thing
 open and Indian sub domain as of now
 and a world region
 as more an more dome
 split it up
 
Kuldeep: and the domain
 what should it be

outpowerhosting: hmmm....
 helpmeworld.com
 lol
 
Kuldeep: don't think about India only
 u there
 i am on Gtalk now
 outpowerhosting: helpmeworld.com
 
Kuldeep: naah
 outpowerhosting: k
 
Kuldeep: who is me here
 
outpowerhosting: you want govt in it?
 
Kuldeep: check letshelptheworld
 outpowerhosting: the one who wants help
 letshelptheworld.com is there

 Kuldeep: what do u think about it
 
outpowerhosting: a bit lengthy

 Kuldeep: han yehi main soch raha tha
 
outpowerhosting: remove lets
 
Kuldeep: willhelp
 check this
 
outpowerhosting: what willhelp.com?
 doesn't make sense yaar
 
Kuldeep: india.willhelp.com

 outpowerhosting: doesn't make sense.. but if you want.. I'll check
 
Kuldeep: india.helptheworld.com
 
outpowerhosting: hmmm..
 so helptheworld.com?
 
Kuldeep: what do you say
 now just because i am wasting your time don't say yes

 outpowerhosting: it's not available

 Kuldeep: is it parked
 
outpowerhosting: i guess so
 
Kuldeep: how do we go about that
 
outpowerhosting: you'll have to pay a heavy sum if you need it
 depends on what the owner asks you for
 
Kuldeep: how much
 K
 leave leave
 think of something else
 i've given u the idea
 if we can eliminate help or govt
 or whatever
 
outpowerhosting: you don't want 'me' in it?
 
Kuldeep: yar i don't want to help me only. i want to help others as well
 
outpowerhosting: k

Kuldeep: so its not about me its about US
 
outpowerhosting: would it be appropriate to think in the lines of solution center?
 something like world solution center wsc.com or something?

Kuldeep: hmm
 sounds good

 outpowerhosting: so? then?

Kuldeep: but do u think wsc would make a good impact

 outpowerhosting: nope
 
Kuldeep: got the answer
 
outpowerhosting: but if you advertise it without the domain name.. then it will help..

 Kuldeep: lets make a difference
 
outpowerhosting: like if you advertise it as world solution center insteand of wsc.com.. it will help
 how would you suggest a domain name for that?
 
Kuldeep: that will be a bit long
 www.makeadifference.com

outpowerhosting: already there
 
Kuldeep: helpworld is not there as well

outpowerhosting: k now?
 
Kuldeep: i am asking ? is it?
 
outpowerhosting: nope.. not available

Kuldeep: u create account for hosting
 i'll tell u the domain name later

outpowerhosting: better to do with domain..
 
Kuldeep: why
 
outpowerhosting: name server issue.. coz if i create the account now.. and then register the domain.. the name server change sometimes might affect the account.. and in rare cases, edit or recreate the account.. but it should work most of the time
 
Kuldeep: world's problem solution
 
outpowerhosting: naaa
 
Kuldeep: center
 center theek nahin hai
 something else
